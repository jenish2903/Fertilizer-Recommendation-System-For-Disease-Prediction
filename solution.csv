"Copper fungicide is one of the most common types of fungicides. Mixtures and proportions of copper in the solution vary, but they're all organic and will be effective against fungal infections including apple scab, powdery mildew, fire blight, rust, and black spot. This copper fungicide by Bonide has excellent reviews."

"Fungicide applications reduced Northern Corn Leaf Blight damage and protected yield. Fungicide value was higher in reducing yield in susceptible corn hybrids. Fungicide were most effective if they were applied at disease onset. Disease onset varied in growth stages, and so the best stage to apply fungicides"
"Compounds available for use on peach and nectarine for bacterial spot include copper, oxytetracycline (Mycoshield and generic equivalents), and syllit+captan; however, repeated applications are typically necessary for even minimal disease control."

"Seed treatment with hot water, soaking seeds for 30 minutes in water pre-heated to 125 F/51 C, is effective in reducing bacterial populations on the surface and inside the seeds. However, seed germination may be affected by heat treatment if not done accurately, while the risk is relatively low with bleach treatment."

Mancozeb and chlorothalonil are perhaps the most frequently used protectant fungicides for early blight management but provide insufficient control under high disease pressure.

"Late blight is controlled by eliminating cull piles and volunteer potatoes, using proper harvesting and storage practices, and applying fungicides when necessary. Air drainage to facilitate the drying of foliage each day is important."
"A plant with bacterial spot cannot be cured. Remove symptomatic plants from the field or greenhouse to prevent the spread of bacteria to healthy plants. Burn, bury or hot compost the affected plants and DO NOT eat symptomatic fruit."
"Spraying fungicides is the most effective way to prevent late blight. For conventional gardeners and commercial producers, protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil (e.g., Bravo, Echo, Equus, or Daconil) and Mancozeb (Manzate) can be used"
"Applying fungicides when symptoms first appear can reduce the spread of the leaf mold fungus significantly. Several fungicides are labeled for leaf mold control on tomatoes and can provide good disease control if applied to all the foliage of the plant, especially the lower surfaces of the leaves."
